Every night
I won't see you
Walk through that door

'Cause time wasn't on
Your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to
Tell you
Bit I really need
You to know

No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby
